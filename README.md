# Final project @ Technigo Bootcamp 2020 (frontend)

My final project at Technigo Bootcamp wraps up all the technologies that I've learned in the last 6 months of the bootcamp. 

I've created a multi-page react plant care managment web-app. After signing up and logging in, the user can create a profile for their plants, with all the information needed for an easier plant care, for example next watering date, location, etc. It also allows the user to upload an image of the plant and delete a plant card. As a stretch goal I opted for sending email notification to the user, but because lack-of time I dropped the idea, saving it for the future.
